**DevWrapped 2025** is an automated, story-driven Year-in-Review experience for developers. Moving beyond dry metrics and dashboards, it uses **Google Gemini AI** to interpret raw GitHub telemetry into human-centric narratives and unique developer archetypes.

---

## ▣ The Vision
Most recap tools focus on numbers: "You made 1,000 commits." We focus on the *rhythm*. 
- Were you a **Quiet Optimizer**, maintaining the foundation of legacy systems?
- Or a **Night Owl Coder**, thriving in the silence of 3:00 AM?

DevWrapped transforms your technical footprint into a cinematic artifact you can be proud to share.

## ◈ Core Features

### 1. Cinematic Storytelling
A multi-step, animated reveal of your year. No sudden data dumps—just a gradual discovery of your consistency, momentum, fluency, and discipline.

### 2. AI-Driven Archetypes
Powered by `gemini-3-flash-preview`, our engine analyzes:
- **Activity Patterns**: Bursts vs. Consistency.
- **Technical DNA**: Language dominance and repo ownership.
- **Behavioral Verbs**: Inferred insights about how you *actually* work.

### 3. Shareable Artifacts
Export custom-rendered PNGs in multiple aspect ratios (1:1, 4:5, 9:16) optimized for LinkedIn, X (Twitter), and Instagram.

### 4. The Intelligence Dossier
A comprehensive, long-form report including:
- **Section I: The Narrative** — A long-form prose summary of your year.
- **Section II: Observations** — Deep-dive behavioral patterns.
- **Section III: Technical DNA** — A breakdown of your tech stack landscape.

### 5. Social Integration
Built-in "Story Hooks" designed to drive healthy engagement. We provide the copy, the hashtags, and the vibe—you provide the journey.
